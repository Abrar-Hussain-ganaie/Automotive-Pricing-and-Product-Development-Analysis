# Bank Loan Case Study

### Summary
This project involves analyzing a loan dataset for a financial institution to mitigate risks associated with loan approvals. The primary goal is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and attributes affecting customer default likelihood.

### Key Objectives
- Identify missing data and handle it appropriately.
- Detect and address outliers.
- Analyze data imbalance and calculate ratios.
- Perform univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analysis.
- Segment customers based on risk and provide actionable insights.

### Methodology
1. **Data Understanding:** Understanding attributes like income, credit score, loan amount, etc.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing data and normalized datasets.
3. **EDA:** Explored individual and interactive variable distributions.
4. **Risk Factor Identification:** Identified attributes associated with loan defaults.
5. **Segmentation:** Grouped customers for targeted strategies.
6. **Recommendations:** Proposed policy changes to mitigate risks.

### Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel:** Data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualizations.

### Insights
- Missing data was identified and addressed using median/mode imputation.
- Outliers in variables like income, number of children, and employment years were detected and handled.
- Data imbalance was analyzed (92% of customers had no payment difficulties).
- Variables like credit amount and income were weakly correlated with default likelihood.

### Visualizations
Key trends were visualized, including:
- Income vs. default rates.
- Credit bins vs. applicant distribution.
- Correlation heatmaps for risk factors.
