# Impact Of Car Features Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset containing 11,159 car models with 16 attributes, including make, engine, fuel type, MSRP, market category, and fuel efficiency. The goal is to provide insights into consumer demand and profitability, helping car manufacturers optimize pricing strategies and product development.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on car models, such as:
- Make
- Engine type
- Fuel type
- MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price)
- Market category
- Fuel efficiency (MPG)
- And more...


## Project Description
This project analyzes the relationship between car features, fuel efficiency, pricing, and popularity in the automotive industry...

## Approach
The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Remove any missing values.
   - Check for outliers in the data.
   - Standardize the format of data for consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Use pivot tables, charts, and descriptive statistics to explore the relationships between the various variables.

3. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Build a regression model to understand the impact of features such as engine type, fuel type, and other factors on the price.

4. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Develop an interactive dashboard in **Excel** to allow the client to explore pricing, car features, and popularity based on different filters.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Use scatter plots, combo charts, and pivot charts for insights.
   - Apply trendlines in the regression model for better interpretation.
   - Utilize summary statistics to understand the correlation between different variables.

## Technology Used

- **Excel**: Used for data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.
- **Advanced Excel Techniques**: Regression analysis, trendlines, pivot charts, and data visualizations.
- **Visualization Tools**: Scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, combo charts, and slicers will be used to make the dashboard interactive and insightful.
- **Functions**: SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, AVERAGEIFS, and correlation functions will be used to calculate averages, sums, and relationships across different variables.

- ## Key Insights:
1. **Market Popularity**: Analyzing how car model popularity varies across market categories.
2. **Price vs. Engine Power**: Understanding how engine horsepower influences pricing.
3. **Price Determinants**: Identifying key features like fuel type and transmission that affect pricing.
4. **Price Across Manufacturers**: Comparing average prices across different car manufacturers.
5. **Fuel Efficiency vs. Engine Cylinders**: Evaluating the relationship between fuel efficiency (MPG) and engine cylinders.
