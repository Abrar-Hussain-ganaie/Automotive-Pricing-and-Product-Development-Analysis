# Automotive Pricing and Product Development Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset containing 11,159 car models with 16 attributes, including make, engine, fuel type, MSRP, market category, and fuel efficiency. The goal is to provide insights into consumer demand and profitability, helping car manufacturers optimize pricing strategies and product development.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on car models, such as:
- Make
- Engine type
- Fuel type
- MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price)
- Market category
- Fuel efficiency (MPG)
- And more...

## Key Insights:
1. **Market Popularity**: Analyzing how car model popularity varies across market categories.
2. **Price vs. Engine Power**: Understanding how engine horsepower influences pricing.
3. **Price Determinants**: Identifying key features like fuel type and transmission that affect pricing.
4. **Price Across Manufacturers**: Comparing average prices across different car manufacturers.
5. **Fuel Efficiency vs. Engine Cylinders**: Evaluating the relationship between fuel efficiency (MPG) and engine cylinders.
